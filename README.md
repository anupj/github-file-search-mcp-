# GitHub Code Explorer using Model Context Protocol

This project demonstrates how to implement the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a GitHub code search tool that could be used by AI assistants.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and services. It defines:

1. How functions are described to AI models
2. How AI models decide which functions to call
3. How parameters are structured and validated
4. How results are returned in a consistent format

## Features

- Search for code across GitHub repositories
- View file contents from repositories
- Search for GitHub repositories
- Function discovery endpoint
- AI assistant simulation interface
